# 🧊 shapegen-archive

A self-updating, hand-curatable field guide to research on **3D shape generation** — synthesizing 3D geometry as meshes, point clouds, SDFs, implicit fields, and gaussians, conditioned on text, images, or nothing at all. One horizontally-scrolling page, one card per paper.

Live at ritteannti818.github.io/shapegen-archive

The site reads like a mid-century archival index. Years are vertical columns along a timeline; every paper is a filed card with a conference-colored tab. Hover a card to peek at its abstract, authors, teaser, and links; click to pin it. The chip row toggles venues on and off, and a small panel swaps palette, background, font, and density.

## What's here

- **Only shape-generation research.** Pure 2D image generation, deterministic reconstruction and SLAM, and novel-view synthesis without a generative model are filtered out at tagging time, so the signal stays dense.
- **Across representations and models.** Mesh, point cloud, voxel, SDF, implicit field, gaussian, and triplane outputs — produced by diffusion, autoregressive, GAN, VAE, flow, feed-forward, and score-distillation methods.
- **Every card links out.** arXiv page, project website, code repo, and one-click BibTeX.

## How it stays alive

The archive updates itself end-to-end — no human merge required. Every scheduler commits straight to the main branch and triggers a redeploy.

- **Weekly** — a crawler pulls new arXiv submissions matching the shape-generation query set, the LLM tags the ones that genuinely belong, and they are promoted into the archive automatically.
- **Monthly** — scrapers re-resolve venues from conference lists, walk each project page for its stated conference and code repo, and refresh author-curated teaser images.

A preprint posted on a Tuesday shows up the following Monday. Once it is accepted to a venue, the tag recolors within a month of the list going public.

## Curating by hand

Automation only ever adds — it dedupes by arXiv link and never overwrites. To fix a mis-tagged entry, edit it directly and push; the next deploy reflects the change.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # localhost:3000
npm run build    # static export
```

## Fork it for your own topic

This repo is really a paper-archive generator. Point it at another field by changing three things: the arXiv query set, the LLM tagging criteria, and the branding. The automation carries over unchanged.
